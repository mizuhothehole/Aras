Research on the Aras client configuration.

1) As I am the windows OS using the Chrome, so I looked into the windows documents.
It told me to disable the pop-up blocker. Which means to change some settings in the settings of Chrome.
In my case, it is under:
chrome://settings/content/popups

And I may add the url that is supposed to.
