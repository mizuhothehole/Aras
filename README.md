# Aras install problems

The Aras is a PLM management system.
It has the structure of C/S, ASP.net, c# and sql server 2012.
When we talk about this, we should know that it is a mid-ware or something, rather than something that is intended to
solve other problems.

1) Aras supports Chrome, but it is minimum Chrome 60 (according to the official documents).
2) Aras supports FireFox, yes, it is as Wang-san said because I installed the newest Firefox and run the browser successfully.
It is OK, but I am not sure if some old versions of firefox will also support it.
3) When we are using IE, we should pay enough attention to the effects on the client session. For the same page, IE try to see
whether there is a new version or not. In case that there is new version and you set the property to let the IE to flash the
version every time, then you need to think about whether the speed is fast enough.
